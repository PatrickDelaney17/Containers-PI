# Step 1. Update the Pi using the terminal
  1. In the terminal ```sudo apt-get update```
  2. Then run ```sudo apt-get upgrade -y``` (__-y__ will accept the space needed for the upgrade if the pi needs patches so you skip getting prompted)
  3. Once done you should reboot the pi ```sudo shutdown -r```  (__-r__ = reboot)
